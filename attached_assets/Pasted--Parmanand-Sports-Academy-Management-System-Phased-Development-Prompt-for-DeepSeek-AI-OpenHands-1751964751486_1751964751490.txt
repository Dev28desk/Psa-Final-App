# Parmanand Sports Academy Management System - Phased Development Prompt for DeepSeek AI & OpenHands

## 🎯 Development Strategy & Git Workflow

### Initial Setup Phase
**Before starting development:**
1. Create a new GitHub repository named: `parmanand-sports-academy`
2. Initialize with README.md and .gitignore for Node.js
3. Create branch structure:
   - `main` (production-ready code)
   - `develop` (integration branch)
   - `feature/*` (individual features)
4. Set up commit conventions: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`

### Development Approach
- **Work in small chunks** to prevent AI overload
- **Take breaks between phases** to review generated code
- **Commit after each successful phase**
- **Test before moving to next phase**
- **Document as you go**

## 🎯 Development Best Practices

### For Each Phase:
1. **Start Fresh**: Clear your context before each phase
2. **Read Previous Code**: Understand what was built before
3. **Small Changes**: Make incremental changes
4. **Test Immediately**: Verify each feature works
5. **Commit Often**: Save progress frequently
6. **Document Changes**: Update README as you go

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls:
- Don't try to build everything at once
- Don't skip the break times
- Don't forget to test after each phase
- Don't ignore error handling
- Don't overcomplicate early phases
- Don't forget to commit your work

### When Stuck:
1. Take a break and review the requirements
2. Check if previous phases are working correctly
3. Simplify the current task
4. Ask for specific help on the stuck part
5. Move to next task and return later
